We hardly check this place anymore for bug reports.

We now use Discord for all BUG REPORTS.
If you do not have Discord you can get it at https://discordapp.com/download

Please use this link https://discord.gg/pTgetAX to get to our Community. By doing this we are providing faster support and faster response time for tickets. This allows us to get issues fixed faster and updated pushed out,

If you decide to post here please expect a wait time of up to a week before we get back to your post.

Thank you.
